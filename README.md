# Carvey Cube Maze
This repository contains a number of python scripts that can be used to generate a random rolling ball maze in the shape of a cube. The maze is generated using a recursive backtracking algorithm that accounts for connectivity points between adjacent faces in the cube.

Output files are created in the form of SVGs for each cube side that can be used with Carvey (https://www.inventables.com/technologies/carvey) or an alternative CNC machine to create the parts for the maze.
